# ECSE429_ProjectB_Cucumber_Test_Suit
This is a project I did while taking McGill ECSE429 course on software testing. 


Testing Suite implemented using Cucumber and REST Assured for testing of API Thingifier version 1.5, Copyright Alan Richardson, Compendium Developments Ltd 2020


In order to setup the project, you need to make sure that Eclipse has Cucumber plug-in installed. Once thatâ€™s done, you can pull the repository, and then it should be ready to run. When running the source code, make sure to run the entire project as a JUnit Test.
